# Weather forecast - react app.

React application displaying current weather and forecast for the next 5 days in London.
Data is refreshed every 1 minute if would be problem with fetching then it is displaying error message and stay with last available forecast.
If I had more time I could add more animation for forecast component, adjust app to mobile screen size and add functionality which allows to select city.

### Instalation

- git clone repository

- go to OpenWeather website and register
- copy paste your key in your local enviroment or just in fetch data url

- go to app folder

- `$ npm install`
- `$ npm start`
